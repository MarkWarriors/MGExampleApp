# MGExampleApp

I tried to write a sample app created from scratch and with some of the knowledge gained during my career.
Here we can see a VIPER architectural approach, app modularization, unit tests, snapshot tests, router-ish implementation and other things.
I didn't care much about the "design" of the app and I also left a few things to change or remove, especially regarding the visual part of it, also there are some test cases that are not implemented, but I do not want with this repository, provide you the example of a "perfect app", but more like an example of how I would structure an app and how I like to organize my work
